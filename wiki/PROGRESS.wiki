#summary Stuff being tested/worked/tuned.
=Revision 254=
  * FIXED Bug: Clicking a tower when orienting a direct fire, creates clicked tower instead of original.
  * Suggest: More money towards the end for defender?
  * Suggest: Bring back medium units?
  * Suggest: Defender gets direct AOE ability?

=Revision 241=
  * DONE Towers need to be stronger.
  * DONE May need to get rid of L M H for units and just do small & large. Can't seem to come up with a viable way for medium units to make sense. You might as well wait to make large ones.
  * DONE Need slightly more money going to the attacker.
  * DONE May need a money cap for the attacker, so he has to spend money or lose potential income from future infusions.
  
=Revision 219=

==Features==
  * KINDA Queueing of multiple unit pre-bought launches.
  * KINDA Make stun targetable, instead of area.
  * KINDA Make haste targetable on squads (not units), instead of area.
  * DONE Keep ability open after a single usage (more like mode)?
  * DONE Message feedback for can't afford tower.
  * NOPE Cooldown on haste/stun?
  * DONE Towers need visual queues to tell what type they are.

==Tuning==
  * DONE Map - Less togetherness of path at the end.

==Bugs==
  * FIXED Emitter deducts money when units are in countdown queue.
  * State issues with lobby.
  * Shield FX sometimes full alpha when shot with painter tower.


=Revision 206=
==Tuning==
  * DONE Attacker flooding early, need less credits & lower infusions early. (now 50/1000)
  * DONE Attacker starved at end, need larger end infusions (was 100/500). (now 50/1000)
  * Attacker build times a bit too lengthy late, lower slightly.
  * DONE Defender painter tower needs to be less effective or more expensive. (now 1/3 of previous effectiveness)
  
==Enhancements/Modifications==
  * DONE Attacker abilities should use credits instead of mana.
  * Defend GUI, keep tower settings between placements.
  * Towers need visual queues to tell what type they are.
  * DONE Higher strength towers should be physically larger.
  * DONE Change sliders to buttons, 1-5.
  * DONE FOV relatively unused, remove slider & make static for tower types?
  * Game mode/Game state handling between rounds.
  
=Revision 176=
==Tuning==
 * DONE Emitter - Faster launch times.
 * DONE Emitter - Minimum launch speed faster.
 * DONE Emitter - Controls squad color, instead of each unit?
 * Tower - Strength max cost higher. Remove strength altogether?
