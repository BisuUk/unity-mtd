Ideas for visual themes


=Tron-ish=

Straight lines and perfect radius curves
  * Dark background
  * Mountains built from 1000s of geometric cubes in the distance
  * Reflective floor
  * Units are geometric in appearance, 8bit graphics look to profiles
  * Paint effects are "bits" (squares, cubes)
  * All units and track have glow effects
  * No directional lights, game world appears to be lit by ambient light from units/track

Pros: quick

Cons: dated and over done, Darwinia and a multitude of other indie games on Steam have this look..

=STYLIZED=

  * Cel shaded
  * No straight lines
  * Overly bright and shiny, semitransparent
  * Loose art style, reflecting the paint splatter
  * "Blobby" units... (think water balloon)
  * Units may or may not look like guns or towers
  * White/light colored ground and background
  * Cartoon style terrain and skybox (think roadrunner cartoon in white)
  * Cartoonish sound effects

Pros: different, matches the current theme well, little change to current gameplay, creative freedom from the "real world"

Cons: maybe too "kiddy", may do better on mobile than Steam, sounds similar to Jelly Defense (2D Android TD game)

----


=3 FACTIONS=

  * 3 factions: Electrical, Nature, Magic
  * Each factions units match the theme (robot walker, tree creature, wizard)
  * Each unit gets additions dependent on level
  * Lots of particle effects, electric bolts, spells, etc
  * Paint towers fire some sort of weapon that allows towers to attack units not in their faction (plasma, resin/pollen, mana)
  * Different maps reflect different factions (mechanical, forest, crystal cave)

Pros: varied enough to please the nerds and geeks, lots of different units, its just cool.

Cons: the most work, slight rework of current gameplay mechanics
