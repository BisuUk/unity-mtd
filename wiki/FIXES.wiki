#summary Stuff that needs to be tuned/fixed.

=Revision 206=

==Tuning==
  * DONE Attacker flooding early, need less credits & lower infusions early. (now 50/1000)
  * DONE Attacker starved at end, need larger end infusions (was 100/500). (now 50/1000)
  * Attacker build times a bit too lengthy late, lower slightly.
  * DONE Defender painter tower needs to be less effective or more expensive. (now 1/3 of previous effectiveness)
  
==Enhancements/Modifications==
  * DONE Attacker abilities should use credits instead of mana.
  * Defend GUI, keep tower settings between placements.
  * Towers need visual queues to tell what type they are.
  * Higher strength towers should be physically larger.
  * DONE Change sliders to buttons, 1-5.
  * DONE FOV relatively unused, remove slider & make static for tower types?
  * Game mode/Game state handling between rounds.
  


=Revision 176=

==Tuning==
 * DONE Emitter - Faster launch times.
 * DONE Emitter - Minimum launch speed faster.
 * DONE Emitter - Controls squad color, instead of each unit?
 * Tower - Strength max cost higher. Remove strength altogether?
 * Tower - Color changing needs to be more expensive and take longer.
 * DONE Tower - Decrease painter effectiveness. Only effects point units?
 * DONE Map - Need to be larger scale.

==Bugs==
 * FIXED Units are attack-able before the reach the start point.
 * FIXED Emitter preview unit sometimes isn't modifiable with the UI.
 * Game state not completely reset at game end.
