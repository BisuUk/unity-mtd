#summary Stuff that needs to be tuned/fixed.

=Revision 176=

==Tuning==
 * Emitter - Faster launch times.
 * Emitter - Minimum launch speed faster.
 * Emitter - Controls squad color, instead of each unit?
 * Tower - Strength max cost higher. Remove strength altogether?
 * Tower - Color changing needs to be more expensive and take longer.
 * Tower - Decrease painter effectiveness. Only effects point units?
 * Map - Need to be larger scale.

==Bugs==
 * Units are attack-able before the reach the start point.
 * Emitter preview unit sometimes isn't modifiable with the UI.
